# Sprinker-circuit
I have made a sprinkler circuit. It takes 4 hygrometers as inputs where each hygrometer measures the humidity at different locations in a garden.
One can use the multiplexer to select which mode to be in. 
This circuit can be printed and be used in a real sprinker system for anyone's gardens. 
The circuit was designed on DigitalWorks.exe
